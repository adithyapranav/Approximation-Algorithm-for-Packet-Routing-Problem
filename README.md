# Approximation-Algorithm-for-Packet-Routing-Problem
We create an Approximation Algorithm which will solve the NP-complete Packet routing problem.

We have created the following graph as a sample graph to test our algorithm:

We have defined 5 packets with the following properties to be sent through the network defined by the graph:
packets = [
    {'src': 1, 'dest': 4, 'size': 5, 'deadline': 15},
    {'src': 2, 'dest': 5, 'size': 8, 'deadline': 20},
    {'src': 3, 'dest': 4, 'size': 10, 'deadline': 25},
    {'src': 1, 'dest': 5, 'size': 6, 'deadline': 18},
    {'src': 2, 'dest': 4, 'size': 7, 'deadline': 22},
]

The following are the results generated from the program:
